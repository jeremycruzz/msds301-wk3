(This post was actually written yesterday.)


After banging my head for a couple hours wondering why this blog post wouldn't render it randomly decided to render at 6:00pm mdt. I then created a new blog post for day3 with the date 2023-10-09 and that wouldnt render. I switched it back to 2023-10-08 and then day 3 decided to render! After tweaking around a little bit I discoverd that pages with a future will not render! Unless the `--buildFuture` tag is added. This aligns with 6:00pm mdt being equivelent to 12:00am utc which is why day 2 decided to render!! I felt like Hugo was gaslightning me.
