  title: "Who am I?"
  content: |
    <p class="lead">
    A software engineer dedicated to producing clean, readable, and testable code across both front-end and back-end environments.
    While I am committed to writing quality code, I'm also easy-going and get along with other engineers and colleagues in various departments.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    My discipline and resilience can be traced back to my days as an army combat medic, a role where precision and effectiveness under pressure were paramount. Taking that frontline experience and combining it with my tech journey has made me who I am today. When I face a challenge, I dive straight in, but always with a level head.
